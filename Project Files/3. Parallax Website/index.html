        <h1>Lion</h1>

        <p>The lion is a wild terrestrial animal called the king of the forest. The lion is a strong animal with a
            strong body, a big head, a majestic mane, and two fierce eyes. Lions are predatory animals and eat only
            after hunting. They have strong claws and sharp teeth, which help them hunt their prey and eat the flesh.
            Lions have yellowish-grey skin colour with smooth hair and an imperious roar which makes a lion unique. The
            footprints of lions are called pug marks. Lions are found chiefly in grasslands, open woodlands, or enclosed
            in zoos. Since they kill their own prey and hunt for food, they have the capacity to run fast.</p>
